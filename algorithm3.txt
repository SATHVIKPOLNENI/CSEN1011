Flow chart to find whether a number is prime or composite

1. Start
2. Accept a positive integer
3. Initialize counter with value 2
4. Divide the the number with 2
5. If the reminder is zero display that positive number is composite and stop the algorithm
6. Else increment the 'counter' and repeat from step 4, until the 'counter' value is less than 'n'
7. After complition of all the steps display that a number 'n' is prime
8. Stop
